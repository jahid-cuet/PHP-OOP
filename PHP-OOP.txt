1. PHP - What is OOP?

  -- Object-Oriented programming is faster and easier to execute.
  -- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
  -- Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

(i) Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

   - OOP is faster and easier to execute
   - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
   - OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
   - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

2. PHP - What are Classes and Objects?

  --  a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class (ex..  class--> Fruit and object-->Apple,Banana etc.)
  -- When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties

3. PHP OOP - Classes and Objects

  -- Individual Object can inherit all the properties(name, color) of a class .

 (i) Define Class and objects
    
    - A class is defined by using the class keyword.
  
  (ii) PHP - The $this Keyword

       -The $this keyword refers to the current object, and is only available inside methods.

  (iii) we change the value of the $name property? There are two ways:

        - Inside the class (by adding a set_name() method and use $this)
        - Outside the class (by directly changing the property value):
        -You can use the instanceof. keyword to check if an object belongs to a specific class

4. PHP - The __construct() Function
   
   - A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.
   - constructor saves us from calling the set_name() method which reduces the amount of code

5. PHP - The __destruct() Function
   - A destructor is called when the object is destructed or the script is stopped or exited.

 As constructors and destructors helps reducing the amount of code, they are very useful

6. PHP OOP - Access Modifiers
 
  There are three access modifiers:

    - public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default
    - protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
    - private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class
 
7. PHP OOP - Inheritance(niye asha)
 -- Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

    - The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class.
    - An inherited class is defined by using the (extends) keyword.
   

8. PHP - Overriding Inherited Methods

  - Inherited methods can be overridden by redefining the methods (use the same name) in the child class

9. PHP - The final Keyword
   - The final keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding.

10. PHP OOP - Class Constants
   - Class constants can be useful if you need to define some constant data within a class.
   
   - A class constant is declared inside a class with the const keyword.

  - A constant cannot be changed once it is declared.

  - Class constants are case-sensitive. However, it is recommended to name the constants in all uppercase letters

  - We can access a constant from outside the class by using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name

  - Or, we can access a constant from inside the class by using the self keyword followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name
