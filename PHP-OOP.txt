1. PHP - What is OOP?

  -- Object-Oriented programming is faster and easier to execute.
  -- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
  -- Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

(i) Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

   - OOP is faster and easier to execute
   - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
   - OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
   - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

2. PHP - What are Classes and Objects?

  --  a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class (ex..  class--> Fruit and object-->Apple,Banana etc.)
  -- When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties

3. PHP OOP - Classes and Objects

  -- Individual Object can inherit all the properties(name, color) of a class .

 (i) Define Class and objects
    
    - A class is defined by using the class keyword.
  
  (ii) PHP - The $this Keyword

       -The $this keyword refers to the current object, and is only available inside methods.

  (iii) we change the value of the $name property? There are two ways:

        - Inside the class (by adding a set_name() method and use $this)
        - Outside the class (by directly changing the property value):
        -You can use the instanceof. keyword to check if an object belongs to a specific class

4. PHP - The __construct() Function
   
   - A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.
   - constructor saves us from calling the set_name() method which reduces the amount of code

5. PHP - The __destruct() Function
   - A destructor is called when the object is destructed or the script is stopped or exited.

 As constructors and destructors helps reducing the amount of code, they are very useful
