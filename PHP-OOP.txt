1. PHP - What is OOP?

  -- Object-Oriented programming is faster and easier to execute.
  -- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
  -- Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

(i) Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

   - OOP is faster and easier to execute
   - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
   - OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
   - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

2. PHP - What are Classes and Objects?

  -- A class is a blueprint used to create objects.A class can have:

        - Properties (variables)

        - Methods (functions)

        - Constructors

        - Access modifiers (public, private, protected)

        - Code implementation

  --  a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class (ex..  class--> Fruit and object-->Apple,Banana etc.)
  -- When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties

3. PHP OOP - Classes and Objects

  -- Individual Object can inherit all the properties(name, color) of a class .

 (i) Define Class and objects
    
    - A class is defined by using the class keyword.
  
  (ii) PHP - The $this Keyword

       -The $this keyword refers to the current object, and is only available inside methods.

  (iii) we change the value of the $name property? There are two ways:

        - Inside the class (by adding a set_name() method and use $this)
        - Outside the class (by directly changing the property value):
        -You can use the instanceof. keyword to check if an object belongs to a specific class

4. PHP - The __construct() Function
   
   - A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.
   - constructor saves us from calling the set_name() method which reduces the amount of code

5. PHP - The __destruct() Function
   - A destructor is called when the object is destructed or the script is stopped or exited.

 As constructors and destructors helps reducing the amount of code, they are very useful

6. PHP OOP - Access Modifiers
 
  There are three access modifiers:

    - public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default
    - protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
    - private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class
 
7. PHP OOP - Inheritance(niye asha)
 -- Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

    - The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class.
    - An inherited class is defined by using the (extends) keyword.
   

8. PHP - Overriding Inherited Methods

  - Inherited methods can be overridden by redefining the methods (use the same name) in the child class

9. PHP - The final Keyword
   - The final keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding.

10. PHP OOP - Class Constants
   - Class constants can be useful if you need to define some constant data within a class.
   
   - A class constant is declared inside a class with the const keyword.

  - A constant cannot be changed once it is declared.

  - Class constants are case-sensitive. However, it is recommended to name the constants in all uppercase letters

  - We can access a constant from outside the class by using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name

  - Or, we can access a constant from inside the class by using the self keyword followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name

11. PHP - What are Abstract Classes and Methods?

   - Abstraction means showing only the necessary details and hiding the internal complexity.
   - It allows you to focus on what something does, not how it does it.

   - An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but not implemented in the code.
   - When inheriting from an abstract class, the child class method must be defined with the same name, and the same or a less restricted access modifier. So, if the abstract method is defined as protected, the child class method must be defined as either protected or public, but not private. Also, the type and number of required arguments must be the same. However, the child classes may have optional arguments in addition
  --> when a child class is inherited from an abstract class, we have the following rules:

    - The child class method must be defined with the same name and it redeclares the parent abstract method
    - The child class method must be defined with the same or a less restricted access modifier
    - The number of required arguments must be the same. However, the child class may have optional arguments in addition
    - Any class that extends Car must implement this method.
    - It cannot be instantiated directly (you cannot do: new Car()).

12. PHP - What are Interfaces?
  -- It is a contract that defines method names but does not provide implementation
   - Interfaces allow you to specify public methods that a class should implement
   - Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way. When one or more classes use the same interface, it is referred to as "polymorphism

  --> PHP - Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes
      - Interface are similar to abstract classes. The difference between interfaces and abstract classes are:

      - Interfaces cannot have properties, while abstract classes can
      - All interface methods must be public, while abstract class methods is public or protected
      - All methods in an interface are abstract, so they cannot be implemented in code and the abstract keyword is not necessary
      - Classes can implement an interface while inheriting from another class at the same time

  --> PHP - Using Interfaces
    - To implement an interface, a class must use the implements keyword.

    - A class that implements an interface must implement all of the interface's methods.

   -- Tar Mane main kotha hoilo interface function define kore je function ta niye amra multiple class e kaj korte pari.

13. PHP OOP - Traits

  --> What are Traits?
    - A trait is a reusable block of code (usually methods) that can be inserted into multiple classes to avoid code duplication.

    - PHP only supports single inheritance: a child class can inherit only from one single parent.

    - So, what if a class needs to inherit multiple behaviors? OOP traits solve this problem

    - Traits are used to declare methods that can be used in multiple classes. Traits can have methods and abstract methods that can be used in multiple classes, and the methods can have any access modifier (public, private, or protected).

14. PHP - Static Methods

    - Static methods can be called directly - without creating an object.
    - Static methods are declared with the static keyword
    - To access a static method use the class name, double colon (::), and the method name(ClassName::staticMethod())
 --> More on Static Methods
    - A class can have both static and non-static methods. A static method can be accessed from a method in the same class using the self keyword and double colon (::)
    - To call a static method from a child class, use the parent keyword inside the child class. Here, the static method can be public or protected.

15. PHP - Static Properties
   
   - Static properties can be called directly - without creating an instance of a class

   - Static properties are declared with the static keyword
   
   - To access a static property use the class name, double colon (::), and the property name (ClassName::$staticProp;)

   - To call a static property from a child class, use the parent keyword inside the child class

16. PHP Namespaces
   -- Namespaces are qualifiers that solve two different problems:

      - They allow for better organization by grouping classes that work together to perform a task
      - They allow the same name to be used for more than one class

17. PHP - What is an Iterable?
   -- An iterable is any value which can be looped through with a foreach() loop

   -- The iterable keyword can be used as a data type of a function argument or as the return type of a function

   -- iterable use kori jate function-e emon value pass hoy jeita foreach diye loop kora jay — like array or generator
